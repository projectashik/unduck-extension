# Privacy Policy - Unduck Search Engine Extension

**Last Updated:** July 23, 2025

## Overview

The Unduck Search Engine Extension is designed to help users set Unduck as their default search engine for improved search productivity with DuckDuckGo bang redirects. This privacy policy explains our data practices.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user information.**

The Unduck extension:
- Does not track your browsing activity
- Does not collect search queries
- Does not store personal information
- Does not use analytics or tracking services
- Does not access your browsing history
- Does not monitor your web activity

## How the Extension Works

The extension operates entirely locally on your device and:

1. **Search Engine Configuration**: Modifies your browser's default search engine setting to use Unduck (unduck.link)
2. **Settings Access**: Provides shortcuts to browser search engine settings pages
3. **Local Operation**: All functionality runs locally in your browser without external data transmission

## Third-Party Services

When you perform searches using Unduck as your search engine:
- Your search queries are sent directly to unduck.link
- These queries are handled according to [Unduck's privacy policy](https://unduck.link)
- We do not intercept, modify, or store these search queries
- The extension acts only as a configuration tool

## Permissions Used

The extension requests minimal permissions:

- **Host Permission (unduck.link)**: Used only to access the Unduck favicon and verify URL format
- **Tabs Permission**: Used only to open browser settings pages when you click "Open Search Settings"

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date.
